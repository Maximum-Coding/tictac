- # React Tic-Tac-Toe
  
  This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. It serves as a learning tool for understanding React concepts and gradually increasing complexity in a React application.

- ## React Concepts Covered
  
  This project covers several important React concepts:  
  
	1. **Components**: The game is divided into reusable components (Game, Board, Square).
	2. **Props**: Data is passed down from parent to child components using props.
	3. **State**: The `useState` hook is used to manage the game's state.
	4. **Lifting State Up**: The game state is managed in the `Game` component and passed down to child components.
	5. **Handling Events**: Click events are handled to make moves and navigate game history.
	6. **Conditional Rendering**: The game status and winner are conditionally rendered.
	7. **Lists and Keys**: The move history is rendered as a list with unique keys.
	8. **Immutability**: The game history is updated immutably.

- ## React Tutorial: Gradual Complexity Increase
  
	1. **Basic Component (Square.jsx)**:

	- Learn to create a functional component.
	- Pass and use props.
	- Handle click events.
	    
		2. **Composite Component (Board.jsx)**:

	- Compose multiple `Square` components.
	- Manage local state for the board.
	- Pass state and callbacks to child components.
	    
		3. **Game Logic (calculateWinner.js)**:

	- Implement game rules in a separate utility function.
	    
		4. **Main Game Component (Game.jsx)**:

	- Manage overall game state.
	- Implement time travel feature.
	- Use the `useState` hook for more complex state management.
	    
		5. **Styling (index.css)**:

	- Apply CSS to style the game board and components.
	    
		6. **App Component (App.jsx)**:

	- Set up the main application structure.
	- Render the `Game` component.
- ## Running the Project
  
	1. Clone the repository.
	2. Navigate to the project directory.
	3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
	4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
	5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

- ## Learning Outcomes
  
  By working through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with:  
- Creating and composing React components
- Managing state in React applications
- Passing data through props
- Handling user interactions
- Implementing game logic
- Styling React components
- Using React hooks (useState)
  
  This project serves as an excellent starting point for understanding React fundamentals and can be extended with additional features for further learning.
